NOTE: These scripts are NOT DIRECTLY EXECUTABLE program-functions (pfunc) 


What is a Program-Function (pfunctions / pfunc_)?

 A script that returns an encapsulated function that may be executed directly or referenced for custom use.
 It commonly has multiple Library dependencies.


When is a Program-Function preferrable for a script/algorithm/system?

 It's when a script fulfills some or all of these criterias...
 * Too complex and/or useful to be an isolated/single script.
 * Too specialized to be useful as a Library.
 * Dependent on (other) Libraries

 Working off the principle that a "Library" may not be dependent on other Libraries.

 F.ex 
 the functionallity for image and brush rotations is universally useful and cannot be limited to
 a single script. However the code is dependent on two other libraries so it may not be
 a library of its own, or included in another library.
